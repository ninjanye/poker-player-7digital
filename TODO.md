##Features
* If pot is low, only play on pair or greater
* consider the flop --> use ranking api
* if we are bb --> check fold
* How much money does the opposition have... base decision on that
* if we are being put all in.... only bet if we have a v.good hand
* bluffing.... ?


##Done
* If high card of >= 10 play, else fold
